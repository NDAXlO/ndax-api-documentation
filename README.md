# Ndax API Documentation 

## Websocket API
The following is documentation based off the websocket protocol. The base endpoint is: **wss://api.ndax.io/WSGateway/**. 

All messages require the following format and must be in json format:
```
{
    "m": 0,
    "i": 0,
    "n":"FUNCTION NAME",
    "o":"PAYLOAD"
}
```
```m``` denotes the message type (0: request)

```i``` denotes the sequence number, which should be none zero and increased with every message. 

```n``` denotes the function name, which is essentially the endpoint for your request.

```o``` contains the payload data in key-value format for your specific request - the payload must be in json format, meaning you must convert the payload as well as the entire request into json.

For example, in python:

```python
payload = {"OMSId":1,
		   "InstrumentId":1}
message = {"m": 0,
		   "i": 1,
           "n":"GetLevel1",
           "o":json.dumps(payload)}
message = json.dumps(message)
socket.send(message)
```

The above is simply for clarification that both the ```o``` part of the message and the entire message itself must be converted to json prior to sending via websocket

### Orderbook - Level 1:
#### Snapshot:
Provides a current Level 1 snapshot (best bid, best offer) of a specific instrument trading on an Order Management System. The Level 1 snapshot does not allow the user to specify the level of market depth information on either side of the bid and ask.

##### Request:

```python
payload = {"OMSId":1,
		   "InstrumentId":1}
message = {"m": 0,
		   "i": 1,
           "n":"GetLevel1",
           "o":json.dumps(payload)}
message = json.dumps(message)
socket.send(message)
```
